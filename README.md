# Sample Portfolio

This repository showcases my personal portfolio, created as part of my journey in learning HTML and CSS. As a beginner, this project represents Day 12 of my learning experience. I utilized the latest version of Tailwind CSS to design an attractive website that highlights my skills as a creative frontend developer.

The site features:
- A modern design with glassmorphism
- Subtle animations
- A timeline of my work
